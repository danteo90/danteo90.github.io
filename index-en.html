					<h2>A community indicator system (CIS) is
					<br />
					a community development monitoring tool.</h2>
					<p>It aims to reveal trends and issues affecting the community in an efficient and non-biased way. A CIS is composed of indicators, which are statistics with meaning in the community. These indicators form an intertwined web of information that allows community members to draw their own conclusions from the information and make informed decisions towards the betterment of their community.</p>

									<h2><strong>Voices of Tasajera</strong> is an essential component of this system. It allows us to bridge data gaps and enrich existing information.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In a way, telling stories from the community is part of the communication component of the project, however they are really a separate entity. Voces de Tasajera is a collection of interviews with community members, giving them the opportunity to tell their story and explain how an indicator affects their life as well as the community. Whether recorded through video or written, the goal of sharing these stories is to give human meaning to the data. Combining quantitative and qualitative evidence helps us understand the community more comprehensively.
